    <h2>What is the Store of Time?</h2>
    <p>Everyone trades time for money, which then can be given to another person to get something in return. But when money is stored in a fiat currency for the future use, it loses the purchasing power over time due to the currency inflation. If a currency lost 25% of its initial value, this means 25% loss of time and efforts spent to get that money. 1 day (8 hours) you worked and got paid for, today has a monetary value as if you worked 0.75 days (6 hours).</p>
    <p>On the other side, when money is stored in deflationary Bitcoin, and its purchasing power increased by 400%, this means getting 400% more value for the time traded in the past. 1 day (8 hours) you worked and got paid for, today has a monetary value as if you worked 5 days (40 hours).</p>
    <p>This website compares Bitcoin, Local Currencies, USD, Stock Indexes, Gold and Silver as a Store of Time.</p>

  <div class="notes-block">
    <h2>Note on Inflation</h2>
    <p>To adjust data for inflation, the website uses Broad Money Supply and Consumer Price Index (CPI) datasets.</p>
    <h3>Broad Money Supply</h3>
    <p>The broad money supply includes currency in circulation, checking/savings deposits, and various functional cash-equivalents that consumers and businesses hold at commercial banks. "Printing" money by increasing the money supply diminishes the value of the currency, its purchasing power falls and prices rise.</p>
    <h3>Consumer Price Index</h3>
    <p>The CPI measures the monthly change in prices paid by consumers. It is calculated by government statisticians and might be manipulated to report lower values, as lower CPI provides benefits to the governments. That's why the Broad Money Supply version will be more accurate.</p>
